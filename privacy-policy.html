        <div class="card">
            <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
            <p>TypeFlow does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
            
            <h3>Service Providers</h3>
            <p>We may share information with trusted third-party service providers who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, provided those parties agree to keep this information confidential.</p>

            <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
            <p>We may disclose information when required by law or in good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect our rights, or ensure user safety.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>Data Security</h2>
            <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
            
            <p>Since most user data is stored locally on your device through localStorage, you maintain control over this information. We recommend keeping your browser and device secure with up-to-date software and strong passwords.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
            <p>TypeFlow is operated from the United States. If you are accessing our Service from outside the United States, please be aware that information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated.</p>

            <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area, you have additional rights under GDPR, including the right to access, update, or delete your information. Since we collect minimal data and store it locally, you can exercise these rights directly through your browser settings.</p>

            <h3>California Users (CCPA)</h3>
