            <h3>Typing Speed Test</h3>
            <p>Start with our typing speed test to establish your current baseline. Choose between time-based tests (15, 30, 60, or 120 seconds) or word-based tests (10, 25, 50, or 100 words).

            <h2>Why Typing Speed Matters</h2>
            <p>In today's digital world, typing proficiency is more than just a convenience—it's a fundamental skill that impacts productivity, career advancement, and daily communication efficiency.</p>

            <h3>Professional Benefits</h3>
            <p>Fast, accurate typing is valued across virtually every profession. Data entry specialists, writers, programmers, administrative assistants, and countless other professionals rely on efficient typing to maximize their productivity. Studies show that improving typing speed from 40 to 70 words per minute can save over an hour per day for knowledge workers.</p>

            <h3>Academic Advantages</h3>
            <p>Students who type efficiently can focus more on content creation and less on the mechanics of getting their thoughts onto the screen. This leads to better essay quality, faster note-taking, and reduced fatigue during long writing sessions. Touch typing also enables better posture and reduces the risk of repetitive strain injuries.</p>

            <h3>Personal Productivity</h3>
            <p>Whether you're writing emails, chatting with friends, or working on personal projects, faster typing translates directly to time savings. The cognitive load of looking at keys and using the hunt-and-peck method interferes with the natural flow of thoughts to text that skilled typists experience.</p>

        <div class="card">
            <h2>The Science of Typing Improvement</h2>
            <p>TypeFlow's approach is based on established principles of motor skill acquisition and muscle memory development.</p>

            <h3>Progressive Difficulty</h3>
            <p>Our lesson structure follows the proven pedagogical approach of building complexity gradually. Starting with the home row keys provides a stable foundation, while each subsequent lesson introduces new finger movements in a logical sequence that minimizes confusion and maximizes retention.</p>

            <h3>Accuracy Before Speed</h3>
            <p>Research consistently shows that focusing on accuracy first, then speed, produces better long-term results than rushing through exercises with high error rates. Our 90% accuracy requirement ensures that muscle memory is built correctly from the start, preventing the formation of bad habits that are difficult to break later.</p>

            <h3>Real-Time Feedback</h3>
            <p>Immediate visual feedback about typing errors allows for quick correction and reinforces proper finger positioning. This creates faster learning cycles and helps identify specific keys or letter combinations that need additional practice.</p>

            <h2>Features and Customization</h2>
            <p>TypeFlow offers several features designed to enhance your learning experience:</p>

            <h3>Multiple Themes</h3>
            <p>Choose from Dark, Light, or Retro themes to match your preference and reduce eye strain during extended practice sessions. Theme selections are saved automatically for your convenience.</p>

            <h3>Adaptive Word Lists</h3>
            <p>Our difficulty levels use carefully curated word lists. Easy mode focuses on short, common words. Medium difficulty incorporates longer vocabulary and more complex letter combinations. Hard mode challenges you with advanced vocabulary and less common word patterns.</p>

            <h3>Progress Tracking</h3>
            <p>All lesson progress and scores are saved locally, allowing you to track improvement over time and resume lessons where you left off. The system remembers which lessons you've mastered and keeps your best accuracy scores for each lesson.</p>

            <h3>Mobile Responsive</h3>
            <p>While typing lessons work best on a full keyboard, TypeFlow is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, making it accessible across devices for review and light practice.</p>
